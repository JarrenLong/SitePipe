        <h3>What is SitePipe?</h3>
        <p>Long Technical was founded way back in 2010 by Jarren Long as the original "one stop technology shop". After just over three great years of service to the Spokane area, Long Technical went on hiatus, before being acquired by Books N' Bytes, Inc. in July of 2017.</p>

        <h3>How Is This Useful?</h3>
        <p>After Books N' Bytes was formed to incorporate Long Technical, Books N' Bytes reorganized the services they provided to break them into separate functionsl units. Instead of doing <i>everything</i>, Long Technical has adopted the role of providing web and software services for Books N' Bytes.</p>

        <h3>Where Do I Get It?</h3>
        <p>Long Technical is now proud to provide low-cost web and software-related services for our clients throughout the Pacific Northwest, specifically the Greater Spokane Area. We are a "time and materials" shop; we charge by the hour, rather than on a per-project basis.</p>
